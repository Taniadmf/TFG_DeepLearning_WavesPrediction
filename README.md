# TFG_DeepLearning_WavesPrediction
Code for my BSc Thesis in Physics: Prediction of wave parameters using CNNs. Wind maps from ERA5 are used to predict wave height, peak period and direction in the Canary Islands. Includes preprocessing, training and evaluation scripts. Data not included due to size.
