The prediction of wave parameters is essential for a wide range of marine and coastal activities, including navigation, 
offshore operations, fishing, tourism, and civil protection. Moreover, anticipating extreme events is crucial to mitigate 
potential impacts on coastal populations and infrastructure. Traditionally, wave prediction has relied on empirical and 
numerical models based on physical equations. However, these approaches present limitations in terms of accuracy and 
computational efficiency, especially in regions with complex orography.

In recent years, machine learning techniques have emerged as promising alternatives for wave prediction, offering greater 
flexibility in handling nonlinear and high-dimensional data. This study assesses the capability of Convolutional Neural Networks 
(CNNs) to predict significant wave height, peak period, and mean wave direction from wind fields.

The proposed methodology involves training and evaluating different CNN architectures using sequences of wind maps as input. 
The results show that CNNs can capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns and provide reasonably accurate predictions, particularly 
for significant wave height and wave direction. The prediction of peak period is more challenging and benefits from a broader temporal 
context. Overall, these findings confirm the feasibility of using CNNs for wave prediction in the Canary Islands region and highlight 
their potential as complementary tools to traditional physical models.
